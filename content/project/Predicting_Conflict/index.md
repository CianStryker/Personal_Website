summary: 'Compared to causal modeling, using Machine Learning techniques to predict violent civil conflict is nascent within the broader conflict literature. In this paper, Liz Masten and I run three Machine Learning models – OLS Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest – on a dataset of our own making to predict instances of violent intrastate conflict. We find our Random Forest model to be the most accurate, but at the expense of high false negative occurrences, to which we assign greater weight considering their ramifications. Both our OLS and Ridge models outperform Random Forest in false negatives, and we assess our Ridge model to be an optimal compromise of high accuracy and low false negative scores. We conclude this paper with caveats to our models and remarks about the limitations and analytical trappings of Machine Learning applications to conflict prediction'
