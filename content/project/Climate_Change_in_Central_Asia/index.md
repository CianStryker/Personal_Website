summary: This  was the final project for my "Spatial Models of Social Science" at Harvard University. This course functioned as an introduction to GIS software with a focus on ArcGIS Pro. I chose to dedicate my final project to studying Climate Change's effect on Central Asia by using Modis NDVI satellite data.
