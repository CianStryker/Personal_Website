summary: 'Anselm Hager, Krzysztof Krakowski, and Max Schaub find that exposure to ethnic violence negatively affects prosocial behavior within and across ethnic groups in Osh, Kyrgyzstan. In expanding upon their work I demonstrate that on the contrary, ethnic violence can have a heterogenous treatment effect, which warrants further analysis of ethnic violenceâ€™s influence on interethnic relations.'
