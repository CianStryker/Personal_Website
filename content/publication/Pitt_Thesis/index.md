abstract: The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent stranded Russian-speaking diaspora in former Soviet republics created a unique environment for testing the effect of political institutions and economic climate on minority integration. Using descriptive quantitative data and over 30 interviews performed in Russian while living in Estonia and Kyrgyzstan, I analyze the levels of integration of both countries' Russian-speaking minorities. Estonia and Kyrgyzstan provide the necessary conditions to test the effect of political institutions and economic climate on minority integration because they differ dramatically in these areas after independence. In comparing the two Russian-speaking minorities, I also assess overall identification, personal relation to the Russian Federation, general relation to the titular population, and reactions to Ukraine and Crimea.My findings from both Estonia and Kyrgyzstan reveal that both minority groups have integrated into their host countries, but the degree of that integration differs substantially. The more robust Estonian economy and the inherent benefits from European Union membership prevented mass emigration after 1991, but slight discriminatory citizenship and Russian language policies result in a less integrated Russian community that tends towards local identification. The more accommodating Kyrgyz governmental policies, both in terms of citizenship and the Russian language, created a highly integrated minority population, but the poor economic climate of Kyrgyzstan incentivized the majority of the Russian-speaking community to immigrate back to Russia. The separate levels of integration and different forms identification achieved by both communities suggest that political institutions largely affect integration, but economic climate dictates emigration and can mitigate detrimental effects from discriminatory political institutions.

summary: Using descriptive quantitative data and over 30 Russian interviews in Estonia and Kyrgyzstan, I analyze the levels of integration of both countries' Russian-speaking minorities. I argue that the separate levels of integration and different forms identification achieved by both communities suggest that political institutions largely affect integration, but economic climate dictates emigration and can mitigate detrimental effects from discriminatory political institutions.
