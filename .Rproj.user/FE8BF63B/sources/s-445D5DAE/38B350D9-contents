summary: In this project I am analyzing China's use of foreign direct investment, especially any investment that is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The project is largley descriptive in nature although I do use some statistical modeling in the form of regressions to demonstrate what economic and political factors may influence Chinese investment decisions.
