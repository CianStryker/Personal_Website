summary: This project and website were my final assignment for my GOV 1005 'Data' class at Harvard University. In this project I analyze China's use of foreign direct investment, especially any investment that is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The project is largley descriptive in nature although I do use some statistical modeling in the form of regressions to demonstrate what economic and political factors may influence Chinese investment decisions.
